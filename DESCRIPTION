Description: This package offers tools for fast, parallel calculation
    of numerical derivatives through finite-difference approximations. It facilitates
    efficient computation of derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians.
    Designed for compatibility with the numDeriv package,
    which has not received updates in several years, it introduces advanced features
    such as computing derivatives of arbitrary order, improving
    the accuracy of Hessian approximations by avoiding repeated differencing,
    and parallelising slow functions on Windows, Mac, an Linux.
