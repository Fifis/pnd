Description: This package provides facilities for fast parallel calculation
    of numerical derivatives based on finite-difference approximation. The main
    functions allow fast computation of approximate gradients of any order,
    Jacobians, and Hessians. Its behaviour is intended to mimic that of
    the numDeriv package that has not received updates in years and is missing
    many useful features such as computing derivatives of arbitrary order or
    reducing the Hessian approximation error by averaging cross-derivatives.
