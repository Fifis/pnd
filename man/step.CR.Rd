\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric scalar: the point at which the derivative is computed and the optimal step size is estimated.}

\item{FUN}{Function for which the optimal numerical derivative step size is needed.}

\item{h0}{Numeric scalar: initial step size, defaulting to a relative step of
slightly greater than .Machine$double.eps^(1/3) (or absolute step if \code{x == 0}).}

\item{version}{Character scalar: \code{"original"} for the original 1974 version by
Curtis and Reid; \code{"modified"} for Kostyrkaâ€™s 2024 modification, which adds an
extra evaluation for a more accurate estimate of the truncation error.}

\item{aim}{Positive real scalar: desired ratio of truncation-to-rounding error. The \code{"original"}
version over-estimates the truncation error, hence a higher \code{aim} is recommended.
For the \code{"modified"} version, aim should be close to 1.}

\item{acc.order}{Numeric scalar: in the modified version, allows searching for a
step size that would be optimal for a 4th-order-accurate central difference
See the Details section below.}

\item{tol}{Numeric scalar greater than 1: tolerance multiplier for determining when to stop
the algorithm based on the current estimate being between \code{aim/tol} and \code{aim*tol}.}

\item{range}{Numeric vector of length 2 defining the valid search range for the step size.}

\item{maxit}{Integer: maximum number of algorithm iterations to prevent infinite
loops in degenerate cases.}

\item{seq.tol}{Numeric scalar: maximum relative difference between old and new
step sizes for declaring convergence.}

\item{diagnostics}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, returns the full iteration history
including all function evaluations.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{FUN}.}
}
\value{
A list similar to the one returned by \code{optim()}: \code{par} -- the optimal
step size found, \code{value} -- the estimated numerical first derivative (central differences;
very useful for computationally expensive functions), \code{counts} -- the number of
iterations (each iteration includes three function evaluations), \code{abs.error} --
an estimate of the total approximation error (sum of truncation and rounding errors),
\code{exitcode} -- an integer code indicating the termination status:
\code{0} indicates optimal termination within tolerance,
\code{1} means that the third derivative is zero (large step size preferred),
\code{2} is returned if there is no change in step size within tolerance,
\code{3} indicates a solution at the boundary of the allowed value range,
\code{4} signals that the maximum number of iterations was reached.
\code{message} -- a summary message of the exit status.
If \code{diagnostics} is \code{TRUE}, \code{iterations} is a list
including the full step size search path, argument grids, function values on
those grids, estimated error ratios, and estimated derivative values.

\details{
This function computes the optimal step size for central differences using the
\insertCite{curtis1974choice}{pnd} algorithm.
If the estimated third derivative is exactly zero, then, the initial step size
is multiplied by 4 and returned.

If 4th-order accuracy (4OA) is requested, then, two things happen. Firstly,
since 4OA differences requires a larger step size and the truncation error for
the 2OA differences grows if the step size is larger than the optimal one,
a higher ratio of truncation-to-rounding errors should be targeted. Secondly,
a 4OA numerical derivative is returned, but the truncation and rounding errors
are still estimated for the 2OA differences. Therefore, the estimating truncation
error is higher and the real truncation error of 4OA differences is lower.
